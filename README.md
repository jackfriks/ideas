hello friend, here are some of my ideas


### Idea #1 
this is what im working on right now.

**Problem:** People are addicted to social media, want to get off, but dont know what they will even do with this new time if they manage it. Blocking the apps doesn't help, since their new time is meant with boredom which just makes them go back to their undesired habits.

**Ideal solution:** An application that guides user to find things they are interested in (CURIOUS ABOUT) and help them take action in that direction. Rather than focusing on what we want to see less off (Scrolling) we focus on what we want to see more of (action doing things we actually want to do/ enjoy / find worthwhile)

**Building?:** Yes @ https://curiosityquench.com

// This started off as me wanting to make a list of things people could try and then mark off if they liked it or not, basically a cross off list for finding "Work that feels like play to you but looks like work to others" - that would stil be cool to add in.

### Idea #2
this is something I want to have exist.

**Problem:** There is currently no easy way to log simple recordings of video progress (log entries) and have it be uploaded to all desired sources. Right now I have to record on my computer, transfer the file to YouTube, wait for it to upload, and uploading it anywhere else takes too much time. I want a simple "Record" on any device and then upload to all platforms solution. (YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Odysee, TikTok, etc) One and done simple recording and maybe even a simple simple editor in house. This is strictly meant for logging thoughts on the go as quick as possible, could also integrate well as a standalone video jouraler with transcriptions thagt make it a searchable database for the person using it

**Ideal solution:** a progressive web app that allows all of the above
Building? Nope (not yet at least). 


### Idea #3
a social media app where there are no likes, followers, or nothing: Just thoughts and ideas which people may publish and consume: limits to 10 mins per user per day. this is weird idk.
